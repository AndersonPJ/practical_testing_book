In other words, we created only one test class holding the whole tests of its methods. To a good organization of the test code, it is possible to create different instances meaning each can hold a bunch of specific tests for a single method.\n","\n","## SetUp() and TearDown()\n","\n","The setUp and tearDown methods are also useful in organizing test cases. When a `setUp` is defined, the test runner will run that method prior to each test. Likewise, if a `tearDown` is defined, the test runner will invoke that method after each test.\n","\n","### **Hands-On**\n","\n","Get ready to start coding with some exercise we prepared for you.\n","\n","It includes **Instances Example** and **SetUp & TearDown Example**.\n","\n","<a \n","href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/damorimRG/practical_testing_book/blob/master/testgranularity/organization_example.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\"> \n","<img alt=\"Open In Colab\" src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\"></a>"]}]}
