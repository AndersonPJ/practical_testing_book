    "# Fuzzing\n",
    "Fuzzing is a software testing technique in which the goal is to automatically feed a given program with a sequence of randomly generated inputs in order to find errors or inadequate behaviors in its execution. The generation of inputs is made by a program called a Fuzzer, which usually strives to create data that is valid enough to be accepted by the test subject while also hitting some obscure edge-case the developers had never thought of. This technique is also very useful for discovering security vulnerabilities in a given system since the random inputs might trigger some exploitable behavior such as a buffer overflows and DoS.\n",

    "## Hands on with pythonfuzz\n",
    "The fuzzer known as [*pythonfuzz*](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/fuzzers/pythonfuzz) is a simple yet powerful example of what a fuzzer can do. In essence, all it does is receive a function which will be called infinitely with different randomly generated inputs each time until it eventually finds an unexpected exception. <br/>\n",
